# Laura - AI Research Assistant for Obsidian

**L**ovable **A**rtificially-intelligent **U**nflappable **R**esearch **A**ssistant

Meet Laura, your AI-powered research companion that helps you build structured, connected knowledge bases in Obsidian using Claude Code.

## What Laura Does

Laura transforms research from overwhelming to systematic:

- **Research any topic** → She creates structured concept notes, source notes, and maps of content
- **Process academic papers** → She extracts key findings, methodology, and creates proper citations
- **Build connections** → She links concepts together, showing relationships and gaps
- **Track progress** → She logs your research journey and generates progress reports
- **Maintain rigor** → She prioritizes peer-reviewed sources for academic work, adapts for professional contexts

**The result:** A connected knowledge base you own completely, ready to write from.

## Philosophy

**AI augmentation, not automation.**

Laura doesn't write your dissertation or make your decisions. She handles the scaffolding - the structure, the connections, the organisation - so you can focus on thinking and understanding.

The knowledge base is yours. The insights are yours. The writing is yours. Laura just makes sure you're working from a solid foundation.

## Who It's For

**Graduate students** building dissertation knowledge with academic rigor

**Professional researchers** getting up to speed fast in unfamiliar domains  

**Knowledge workers** doing deep research for work projects

**Lifelong learners** building systematic understanding of complex topics

Anyone who wants AI to help them think, not just answer questions.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Prerequisites

**Required:**
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

See [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Clone This Repository

```bash
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/curiouscoach-tools/obsidian-research-assistant.git
cd obsidian-research-assistant
```

### 3. Create a Research Vault

**Linux/macOS/WSL:**
```bash
./setup-vault.sh <vault-path> <type> [vault-name]

# Examples:
./setup-vault.sh ~/vaults/dissertation academic "PhD Research"
./setup-vault.sh ~/vaults/work-notes knowledge "Work Notes"
./setup-vault.sh ~/vaults/daily journal "Work Journal"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\setup-vault.ps1 -VaultPath <path> -VaultType <type> [-VaultName <name>]

# Examples:
.\setup-vault.ps1 -VaultPath "$env:USERPROFILE\vaults\dissertation" -VaultType academic -VaultName "PhD Research"
.\setup-vault.ps1 -VaultPath "$env:USERPROFILE\vaults\work-notes" -VaultType knowledge -VaultName "Work Notes"
.\setup-vault.ps1 -VaultPath "$env:USERPROFILE\vaults\daily" -VaultType journal -VaultName "Work Journal"
```

**Vault types (required):**
| Type | For | Included Skill |
|------|-----|----------------|
| `academic` | Dissertations, papers, formal research | laura-academic |
| `knowledge` | Work research, learning, PKM | laura-professional |
| `journal` | Reflection, journaling, growth tracking | casey |

Use `/skills add alex` in your vault to add other skills.

### 4. Open in Obsidian

File → Open folder as vault → Navigate to your vault → Open

### 5. Start Researching

```bash
cd ~/vaults/my-research
claude
```

Then type `/laura` (or `/casey` for journal vaults) and prompt: `"Research the fundamentals of [your topic]"`

**Add more skills with `/skills`:**
```
/skills                           # List installed and available
/skills add alex                  # Add solution architect
/skills add riley                 # Add product owner
/skills switch laura academic     # Switch Laura variant
```

Once installed, use `/alex` or `/riley` to activate them.

## Key Features

✅ **Creates actual files** - Markdown notes in your Obsidian vault, not just chat responses
✅ **Academic rigor** - Prioritizes peer-reviewed sources, proper citations, methodology notes
✅ **Academic integrity** - Never fabricates sources; marks unverified claims with `#verify` and `#needs-citation`
✅ **Systematic connections** - Every note links to related concepts
✅ **Progress tracking** - Built-in timeline and progress reporting
✅ **Multi-persona support** - Add Alex (architecture), Riley (product), or other expert perspectives
✅ **Cross-platform** - Windows, macOS, Linux/WSL
✅ **You own everything** - All files local, no subscriptions, no lock-in  

## What's Different?

Most AI tools give you a conversation. Laura gives you **artifacts**.

She doesn't just answer "what is machine learning?" - she creates:
- `/concepts/machine-learning.md` with definition, context, examples
- `/concepts/supervised-learning.md` linked to ML
- `/concepts/neural-networks.md` linked to ML
- `/sources/goodfellow-2016-deep-learning.md` with full citation and key findings
- `/themes/ai-fundamentals.md` connecting all the concepts

Everything lives in your Obsidian vault. Everything connects. Everything is yours.

## How It Works

### Repository Structure (The Factory)

This repository contains the **tooling to create research vaults**:

```
obsidian-research-assistant/
├── setup-vault.sh           # Creates vaults (Linux/macOS/WSL)
├── setup-vault.ps1          # Creates vaults (Windows PowerShell)
├── skills/                  # Skill files (flat .md)
│   ├── registry.json        # Skill metadata
│   ├── skills-manager.md    # The /skills command handler
│   ├── laura-academic.md    # Strict verification for dissertations/theses
│   ├── laura-professional.md # Lighter weight for work research
│   ├── alex.md              # Architecture expertise
│   ├── riley.md             # Product ownership
│   └── casey.md             # Reflection and journaling
├── templates/               # Note templates for vaults
│   ├── source-note.md
│   ├── concept-note.md
│   ├── question-note.md
│   └── map-of-content.md
├── config/                  # Configuration templates
│   ├── gitignore.template
│   ├── vault-readme.template
│   └── vault-claude.template
└── docs/
    └── installation.md      # Setup guide
```

### Created Vault Structure

When you run `setup-vault.sh`, it creates a **separate research vault**:

```
my-research/                 # Independent git repository
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/            # Skills (auto-discovered by Claude Code)
│       ├── skills/        # The /skills manager (always installed)
│       │   └── SKILL.md
│       └── laura/         # Included with vault (add others via /skills)
│           └── SKILL.md
├── sources/
│   ├── raw/               # Your PDFs (gitignored)
│   └── *.md               # Structured source notes
├── concepts/              # Individual concept explanations
├── context/               # Situational context (your specific situation)
├── themes/                # Maps of Content
├── questions/             # Open research questions
├── _meta/
│   ├── research-log.md
│   └── domain-context.md
├── _templates/            # Copied from factory
├── CLAUDE.md              # Project-specific context (includes skill-source path)
└── README.md
```

Each vault is:
- A separate git repository (not related to the factory)
- Self-contained and portable
- Can be pushed to its own GitHub repo
- Contains all your research for one project

## Core Workflows

### Initial Research

```
You: "I need to understand quantum computing fundamentals"

Laura:
1. Clarifies scope if needed
2. Identifies 3-5 authoritative sources
3. Creates concept notes with definitions and relationships
4. Creates source notes with summaries and citations
5. Builds Map of Content as navigation hub
6. Logs progress to timeline
7. Commits to git
```

### Processing Sources

```
You: [Download PDF using university access]
You: "Process the quantum computing paper I added to sources/raw/"

Laura:
1. Extracts text from PDF
2. Creates structured source note with citation
3. Identifies key concepts (creates or updates concept notes)
4. Cross-references with existing knowledge
5. Flags contradictions
6. Logs significant findings
```

**Note:** Web fetching often fails for academic publishers (403 errors due to bot protection). The manual download workflow is more reliable and respects paywalls/access controls.

### Progress Reporting

```
You: "Summarize my progress for my supervisor meeting"

Laura:
1. Reads research timeline
2. Analyzes activity patterns
3. Generates summary:
   - Breakthroughs and key insights
   - Research activity (sources processed, notes created)
   - Active blockers
   - Suggested next steps
```

## Multi-Persona Support

Laura is a research assistant. But sometimes you need different perspectives:

**Laura** (Research Assistant) - Two variants:
- *Academic* - Strict verification for dissertations/theses. Never fabricates sources, marks all AI claims with `#verify`, includes submission checklist
- *Professional* - Lighter overhead for work research. Good practices without heavy verification workflow

**Alex** (Solution Architect) - Architecture decisions, technology evaluation, risk assessment

**Riley** (Product Owner) - User stories, value propositions, prioritisation

**Casey** (Reflection Buddy) - Daily journaling, weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews, pattern recognition, growth tracking

Each persona reads what the others have built and contributes their expertise to the same vault. See the demo video scripts for examples of Laura → Alex collaboration on technical investigations.

## Example Use Cases

### Academic Research
"Research the fundamentals of sustainable transport planning for my dissertation. I need peer-reviewed sources."

→ Laura creates 10 concept notes, 5 source notes from academic journals, 1 map of content

### Professional Investigation  
"I've been asked to evaluate data streaming platforms. Professional sources are fine."

→ Laura researches options, Alex evaluates tradeoffs, you present confidently

### Personal Learning
"Help me understand reinforcement learning - I'm a developer but new to ML."

→ Laura builds foundational concepts, connects to what you already know

## Getting Started Quickly

**First prompt in your new vault:**
```
I'm researching [topic] for my [dissertation/project/learning].

My main questions are:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

Please read CLAUDE.md and help me start building systematic knowledge.
```

**Then try:**
- `"Research the fundamentals of [topic]"` - Creates initial concept notes and sources
- `"Process the paper I added to sources/raw/"` - Structures a downloaded PDF
- `"Summarize my progress this week"` - Generates progress report

See [Quick Start Prompts](docs/quick-start-prompts.md) for comprehensive prompt library with detailed examples.

## Managing Skills

Skills (personas) are managed using the `/skills` command inside each vault:

```
/skills                           # List installed and available skills
/skills add alex                  # Install alex skill
/skills remove alex               # Remove alex skill
/skills switch laura academic     # Switch Laura to academic variant
/skills update                    # Update all skills from repo
/skills update laura              # Update specific skill
```

When skills evolve in this repo, use `/skills update` to refresh your vault's copies.

**Note:** The skill source path is stored in your vault's CLAUDE.md. If you move the repo, update the `skill-source:` line.
