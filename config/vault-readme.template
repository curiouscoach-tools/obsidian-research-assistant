## How to Use

### Starting a Research Session
1. Open this vault in Obsidian
2. Use Claude Code to conduct research: "Research [topic]"
3. Or manually add sources to `sources/raw/` and prompt: "Process the paper I added"

### Creating Notes
- Use templates from `_templates/` folder
- Enable Obsidian Templates plugin and set template folder to `_templates`
- Every note should link to at least 2 other notes

### Tracking Progress
- Session summaries go in `_meta/research-log.md`
- Research agenda maintained in `_meta/research-backlog.md`
- Git commits track knowledge changes

### Generating Reports
Ask Claude Code: "Summarize my research progress over the last 2 weeks"

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View research progress
cat _meta/research-log.md
cat _meta/research-backlog.md

# Git workflow (usually handled by Claude Code)
git status
git log --oneline
git push  # if connected to remote
```
