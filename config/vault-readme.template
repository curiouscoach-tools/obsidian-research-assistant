- View timeline: `bl timeline --since "1 week ago"`
- Git commits track knowledge changes

### Generating Reports
Ask Claude Code: "Summarize my research progress over the last 2 weeks"

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View recent activity
bl timeline --since "1 week ago"

# Log research progress
bl note "Processed 3 sources on [topic]"
bl win "Major insight: [discovery]"
bl blocker "Need access to [source]"
