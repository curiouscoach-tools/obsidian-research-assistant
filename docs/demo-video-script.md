# Laura Demo Video Script
## Audience: Dissertation students (non-technical)
## Format: Screen recording + voiceover
## Target length: 2-3 minutes

---

## PRE-PRODUCTION NOTES

**What to have ready before recording:**
- A fresh vault created but empty (so the "magic moment" is clean)
- Terminal open in vault directory
- Obsidian open on the empty vault
- Split screen: terminal left, Obsidian right
- Use Spanish Civil War dissertation as the demo topic

**Recording tip:**
- Record in one take if possible - natural pace feels more authentic
- Don't over-edit - slight hesitations feel human, not incompetent
- The key visual moment is files appearing in Obsidian in real time

## THE SCRIPT

---

### SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM [0:00 - 0:25]

**[SCREEN: Blank Obsidian vault - empty, nothing in it]**

VOICEOVER:
"You've got your dissertation topic. You know roughly what you want 
to argue. But you're staring at a blank screen, not sure where to 
start - and you've got months of reading ahead of you."

**[SCREEN: Pause on empty vault for 2 seconds]**

VOICEOVER:
"Laura is a research assistant that lives inside your notes. 
You describe what you're researching, and she builds your 
knowledge base for you - structured, connected, and ready to write from."

---

### SECTION 2: MEET LAURA [0:25 - 0:50]

**[SCREEN: Switch to terminal]**

VOICEOVER:
"You launch her with one word."

**[SCREEN: Type `laura` and press enter - show the welcome banner appearing]**

VOICEOVER:
"She tells you what vault you're in, what she can help with,
and how to get started."

**[SCREEN: Let the full welcome display, pause 2 seconds so viewer can read it]**

VOICEOVER:
"Then you just... talk to her."

---

### SECTION 3: THE MAGIC MOMENT [0:50 - 1:40]

**[SCREEN: Split - terminal left, Obsidian right (still empty)]**

VOICEOVER:
"I'm researching the Spanish Civil War for my dissertation. 
I want to argue it was a European conflict, not just a Spanish one.
Here's my opening prompt."

**[SCREEN: Type the prompt - paste it in, don't type live]**

```
Read CLAUDE.md to understand this research project. 
This is my master's dissertation so I need peer-reviewed 
academic sources.

Start by researching the International Brigades - the volunteers 
who came from across Europe to fight in Spain.
```

**[SCREEN: Hit enter. Show Laura working - the terminal activity]**

VOICEOVER:
"Watch the right side."

**[SCREEN: ZOOM to Obsidian - files start appearing in the folders]**

**[SCREEN: Show files populating in real time:]**
- concepts/international-brigades.md
- concepts/foreign-volunteers.md
- concepts/ideological-motivation.md
- sources/[paper].md
- sources/[paper].md

VOICEOVER:
"She's not just answering a question. She's building your notes.
Every concept gets its own file. Every source gets its own file.
All structured, all connected."

---

### SECTION 4: INSIDE THE VAULT [1:40 - 2:10]

**[SCREEN: Switch fully to Obsidian, open a concept note]**

VOICEOVER:
"Open any note and you've got a proper academic summary -
key arguments, the sources behind it, and links to related ideas."

**[SCREEN: Show the wikilinks in the note - hover over one to show preview]**

VOICEOVER:
"These links aren't decoration. Click one and you're straight 
to that concept. Everything connects."

**[SCREEN: Switch to Obsidian Graph View]**

VOICEOVER:
"After one session, you can already see your knowledge taking shape."

**[SCREEN: Pause on graph view for 3 seconds - let it sink in]**

---

### SECTION 5: THE PAYOFF [2:10 - 2:40]

**[SCREEN: Back to terminal]**

VOICEOVER:
"A few sessions in, you've got a supervisor meeting.
You ask Laura to summarise your progress."

**[SCREEN: Type:]**
```
Summarise my research progress this week for my supervisor meeting.
```

**[SCREEN: Show Laura generating a structured summary]**

VOICEOVER:
"Topics covered, sources processed, open questions, 
suggested next steps. In about ten seconds."

**[SCREEN: Brief pause]**

VOICEOVER:
"Laura doesn't write your dissertation. That's still your thinking,
your argument, your words. But she handles the scaffolding -
so you can focus on the ideas."

---

### SECTION 6: CLOSE [2:40 - 2:55]

**[SCREEN: Back to graph view - the connected vault]**

VOICEOVER:
"Laura is free, open source, and works on Windows and Mac.
Everything she builds lives in your own notes - 
you own it completely, no subscriptions, no lock-in."

**[SCREEN: Fade to black or simple end card]**

VOICEOVER:
"Link in the description to get started."

## TOTAL RUNTIME: ~2:50

## POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

**Cuts to make:**
- Jump cut between typing prompt and files appearing (hide the wait time)
- Speed ramp on file creation if it takes more than 5 seconds
- Cut any awkward silences in terminal output

**Titles to add (optional):**
- "1 prompt" over the typing section
- "12 structured notes" over the Obsidian section
- "10 seconds" over the summary section

**Music:**
- Light, neutral background music (low volume)
- Something calm - this isn't a hype video, it's "look how calm and organised research can be"

**Thumbnail idea:**
- Split: chaotic pile of papers (left) vs clean Obsidian graph (right)
- Text: "Research smarter, not harder"

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- Don't explain what Obsidian is - just use it
- Don't explain what Claude Code is - just show it working
- Don't show installation or setup - that's what the docs are for
- Don't use jargon (wikilinks, vault, CLI) - just show the thing
- Don't apologise for the terminal - it looks powerful, not scary
