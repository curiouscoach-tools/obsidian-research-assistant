# Laura Demo Video Script - Professional Researcher
## Audience: Non-academic professionals (analysts, PMs, consultants)
## Format: Screen recording + voiceover
## Target length: 2-3 minutes

---

## PRE-PRODUCTION NOTES

**What to have ready before recording:**
- A vault with some prior research already in it (shows Laura in context, not starting cold)
- Terminal open in vault directory
- Obsidian open showing existing notes from a previous session
- Split screen: terminal left, Obsidian right
- Demo scenario: "You've been asked to investigate data streaming platforms"

**The narrative arc:**
This is a different story from the academic version. It's not "help me start" -
it's "help me get up to speed fast and look smart in the room."
The emotional hook is confidence, not organisation.

**Recording tip:**
The graph view at the end should look impressively connected - 
record this after a proper research session, not a fresh demo vault.

## THE SCRIPT

---

### SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM [0:00 - 0:25]

**[SCREEN: Obsidian vault with some existing notes visible]**

VOICEOVER:
"You've just been asked to lead an investigation into data streaming 
platforms. You've got a week before you're presenting options to 
senior stakeholders."

**[SCREEN: Pause - let the weight of that land]**

VOICEOVER:
"You're not a specialist. But you need to sound like one.
And you need to know enough to ask the right questions,
spot the gaps, and challenge the assumptions."

**[SCREEN: Pause on vault]**

VOICEOVER:
"This started as a research tool for dissertation students.
But it turns out the problem is the same - 
you need to build structured knowledge, fast,
in territory you don't yet know."

---

### SECTION 2: MEET LAURA [0:25 - 0:45]

**[SCREEN: Switch to terminal]**

VOICEOVER:
"Laura is a research assistant who builds your knowledge base 
as you work. You've already used her to research the basics."

**[SCREEN: Type `laura` - show welcome banner]**

**[SCREEN: Show Obsidian - some concept notes already exist from previous session]**

VOICEOVER:
"She's already helped you understand the fundamentals.
Now you need to go deeper - and start making decisions."

---

### SECTION 3: GOING DEEPER [0:45 - 1:20]

**[SCREEN: Split - terminal left, Obsidian right]**

VOICEOVER:
"You ask Laura to research the leading platforms in depth -
what they're good at, where they struggle, 
and what organisations like yours have learned 
from implementing them."

**[SCREEN: Type prompt:]**
```
Research the leading data streaming platforms in depth.
I need to understand real-world implementation experiences,
not just marketing claims. Professional sources are fine.
```

**[SCREEN: Files appearing in Obsidian - concepts, sources populating]**

VOICEOVER:
"She pulls from technical documentation, industry analysis,
case studies. Everything lands in your vault -
structured, sourced, ready to reference."

**[SCREEN: Open a source note - show the structured content]**

VOICEOVER:
"Not a wall of text. Structured notes.
Key findings, critical assessment, links to related concepts."

---

### SECTION 4: BRINGING IN EXPERTISE [1:20 - 1:55]

**[SCREEN: Back to terminal - close Laura, type `alex`]**

VOICEOVER:
"Here's where it gets interesting. Laura is a researcher.
But for a decision like this, you need more than research -
you need someone to challenge your thinking."

**[SCREEN: Show Alex welcome banner appearing]**

VOICEOVER:
"Alex is an architecture expert. Same vault, different perspective.
Where Laura gathers knowledge, Alex interrogates it."

**[SCREEN: Type prompt:]**
```
Read CLAUDE.md and Laura's research. 
Evaluate our platform options and tell me 
what questions I should be asking that I probably haven't thought of.
```

**[SCREEN: Alex generating output - show it appearing]**

VOICEOVER:
"Alex reads everything Laura built, then starts asking 
the uncomfortable questions. Scalability at cost.
Operational complexity. What happens when it goes wrong at 2am.
Lock-in risk. Skills gaps."

**[SCREEN: Show a structured evaluation note appearing in /architecture/]**

VOICEOVER:
"The kind of questions that make you look very well prepared
when you're in a room with people who've been doing this for years."

---

### SECTION 5: THE PAYOFF [1:55 - 2:25]

**[SCREEN: Switch to Obsidian graph view - well connected vault]**

VOICEOVER:
"After a few sessions, you've got a connected knowledge base.
Research, analysis, open questions, decision frameworks.
All in one place. All linked together."

**[SCREEN: Back to terminal, type:]**
```
Summarise the key findings and the decision I need to make
for a senior stakeholder presentation.
```

**[SCREEN: Show structured summary generating]**

VOICEOVER:
"You're not starting your presentation from scratch.
You're editing down from something already well structured."

**[SCREEN: Brief pause on the summary]**

VOICEOVER:
"Laura and Alex don't make the decision. That's still yours.
But they make sure you've thought it through properly -
and that you can defend it in the room."

---

### SECTION 6: CLOSE [2:25 - 2:50]

**[SCREEN: Graph view one more time]**

VOICEOVER:
"You can build out as many expert perspectives as your 
investigation needs. A product lens. A technical lens. 
A risk lens. Each one reading what the others have built,
each one asking different questions."

**[SCREEN: Brief shot of multiple persona launchers - laura, alex - in terminal]**

VOICEOVER:
"It's free, open source, and everything lives in your own files.
No subscriptions. No lock-in. Just structured thinking, 
when you need it most."

**[SCREEN: Fade to black or simple end card]**

VOICEOVER:
"Link in the description to get started."

## POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

**The tonal difference from the academic version:**
- Academic: "help me start, help me organise"
- Professional: "help me look smart, help me challenge assumptions"
- This script is about CONFIDENCE, not organisation

**Cuts to make:**
- Jump cut on both Laura and Alex processing (hide wait times)
- Speed ramp on file creation
- Hard cut between Laura and Alex sections - the transition
  between personas is a key moment, don't bury it

**Titles to add (optional):**
- "Week 1: Research" over the Laura section
- "Week 1: Challenge" over the Alex section
- "Presentation ready" over the summary section

**The key visual moment here is different from the academic version:**
- Academic: files appearing in empty vault (wow, it builds things!)
- Professional: Alex reading Laura's work (wow, they talk to each other!)
Make sure the handoff between Laura and Alex is visually clear.

**Music:**
- Slightly more purposeful than the academic version
- Still calm, but with a bit more drive - this person is under pressure

**Thumbnail idea:**
- Person confidently presenting (right) vs same person looking overwhelmed
  at laptop (left)
- Text: "From brief to presentation in days, not weeks"

**What to say if asked "is this just ChatGPT?":**
The key difference worth knowing:
- Laura and Alex create FILES in your vault that persist and connect
- They read each other's work and build on it
- You own everything, it lives on your machine
- It's a knowledge base, not a chat window

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- Don't name the technology (Kafka, Kubernetes etc) - keep it "data streaming"
- Don't explain what Obsidian is - just use it
- Don't show installation - that's what the docs are for
- Don't make it feel like a coding tool - the terminal is just how you call them
- Don't oversell - "helps you think better" beats "does the work for you"
